# Download the wells-startup script by entering the following command in SIFT's Terminal.
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyardley/Rootkit-mount/master/wells-startup /etc/init.d/

# Next, you need to make your script executable by root by changing the file's permissions using the following code:
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/wells-startup

# Finally, you need to register your script to run at startup with this command (it will probably give you warning about missing LSB tags you can ignore):
sudo update-rc.d wells-startup defaults
